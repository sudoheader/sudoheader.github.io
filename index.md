## Setup

Normally I would go with Kali Linux but it is not entirely necessary. Windows is also sufficient --- check out [PentestBox](https://pentestbox.org/).

BTW I use [Arch](https://archlinux.org)

And [vim](https://vim.org) but I have grown accustomed to using [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)---a FOSS implementation of VSCode. With vim keybindings of course.

Install the Python extension from Microsoft.

### Arch Linux Install

There are many ways to install [Arch](https://archlinux.org) but the way that I installed it was by reading the [Arch Linux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide) and following most of [this](https://gist.github.com/huntrar/e42aee630bee3295b2c671d098c81268) tutorial. I installed [linux-hardened](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/linux-hardened/) kernel however.

#### VMWare vs. Virtual Box

For all intents and purposes, one should stick with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) but I recommend [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/) if possible.
